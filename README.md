## About

Gale is a fork of [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper). It is intended to provide strong performance.
The project is in open alpha.

## Current features

* **Faster threading system**\
  Gale comes with a custom threading system, that immediately makes terrain generation 2-3x faster than Paper on most systems! Try it for yourself and see.
* **Micro-optimizations**\
  A number of micro-optimizations that do not change game mechanics from other projects, such as [Airplane](https://github.com/TECHNOVE/Airplane) and [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric), are also included. Every included optimization has been carefully tested and reviewed line-by-line; faulty or risky optimizations will not be added.
* **Fixes and options**\
  Gale contains fixes for a few small Minecraft bugs from [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur), options to disable some console logs, the option to re-enable sand duping, and more. Every change is fully configurable, and can always be set to Paper behavior.
* **Variable entity wake-up**\
  Waking up inactive entities happens spread over time, instead of many entities at once, which makes entities feel and behave more natural.

## Acknowledgements
