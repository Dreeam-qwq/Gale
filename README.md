## About

Gale is a fork of [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper). It is intended to provide strong performance, but we do not make any specific claims.
The project is in open alpha. We do not recommend running it on your production server.

## Features

Gale aims to include good patches other forks have, with added configuration options if gameplay is affected. Unnecessary or risky patches will not be added. See a comparison with other forks [here](https://github.com/GaleMC/Gale/wiki/Comparison-with-other-forks).

## Making your own fork

If you would like to make a Paper fork based on Gale, check out the tutorial [here](https://github.com/GaleMC/Gale/wiki/Tutorial:-Making-your-own-fork).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed! Don't be afraid to submit a pull request that you may feel is just for yourself. All ideas are welcome. To learn how to submit pull requests, check out the tutorial [here](https://github.com/GaleMC/Gale/wiki/Tutorial:-Contributing).

## Building from source

If you only want to build the Gale .jar file yourself, without a plan to add or change any patches, check out the tutorial [here](https://github.com/GaleMC/Gale/wiki/Tutorial:-Building-from-source).

## Acknowledgements

This fork would not exist without the years-long work of all the contributors to the [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) projects,
including the dedication of their community to stability and trust among all users.
Over the years, many forks of Paper have appeared, including some that contain changes that are too minor to be worth inclusion and maintaining by the Paper project.
We gratefully include various tested and carefully individually reviewed changes from Paper forks, including [Airplane](https://github.com/TECHNOVE/Airplane), [Mirai](https://github.com/etil2jz/Mirai), [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur), [JettPack](https://gitlab.com/Titaniumtown/JettPack), [Patina](https://github.com/PatinaMC/Patina), [KeYi](https://github.com/KeYiMC/KeYi), [EmpireCraft](https://github.com/starlis/empirecraft) and [Slice](https://github.com/Cryptite/Slice), and from various Fabric mods, including [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric), [VMP](https://github.com/RelativityMC/VMP-fabric) and [C2ME](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric).
We would also like to thank our friends at [MultiPaper](https://github.com/MultiPaper/MultiPaper) and MCMT ([Fabric](https://github.com/himekifee/MCMTFabric), [Forge](https://github.com/jediminer543/JMT-MCMT)) for their shared knowledge and hard work towards a common goal.
